Reproducibility repository for paper with title: The World Trade Web: A Deep Learning Approach to Link Weight Prediction by Miguel Lozano. Abstract: Building on the Gravity Model of Trade, this paper uses a deep neural network with the purpose of link weight prediction in the world trade web (WTW), this is, predicting the magnitude of the trade interactions between countries. The inputs for prediction are characteristics of the interacting countries like trade openness and freedom, as well as their bilateral relationship traits, which include variables like distance between them and booleans such as whether they are in the same continent, share borders, language, ethnicity, trade agreements, legal system, among others. The results of using deep learning are favorable, improving performance obtained by multiple regression by as much as 8%
Inside Code.zip you will find the code that I used for cleaning the datasets and to process the deep neural networks.
The datasets that the code refers to were too heavy to upload, but you can find them in the following link: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8jv7fdv44lucqoi/AADzu7JgXoPX1LUl9zvAkfGZa?dl=0
